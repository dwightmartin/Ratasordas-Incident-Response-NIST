# **Ratasordas Technologies: Incident Executive Summary**

### **Project Overview**

This project outlines a post-incident report and strategic plan for Ratasordas Technologies, a fictional company, following a data manipulation attack that rendered their app unusable. The report uses the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0** to analyze the incident and provides a strategic roadmap for improving the companyâ€™s security posture.

### **Key Findings & Actions Taken**

A targeted data manipulation and denial-of-service attack rendered Ratasordas Technologies' app unusable for three days. The incident's root cause was a **governance failure**, as a critical server managed by a third-party contractor lacked Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and was insecurely configured.  
Upon detection, the cybersecurity team and the application developer acted swiftly. The server was immediately secured, and the graphics were restored from the company's internal backup system. However, the recovery process was significantly delayed due to a lack of a standardized naming convention for graphic files.

### **Strategic Recommendations**

To improve security and prevent future incidents, we recommend a strategic plan based on the NIST framework, focusing on:

* **Govern:** Establishing a formal **Vendor Risk Management (VRM) program** to proactively set and enforce security expectations for all third-party contractors.  
* **Protect:** Implementing a **zero-trust** policy for all systems and a mandatory cybersecurity training plan to address human-related vulnerabilities.  
* **Detect:** Deploying a centralized logging and monitoring system to enable real-time alerting on unusual activity and prevent future incidents.  
* **Respond:** Creating a formal **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** with clear communication protocols and a chain of command for managing security events.  
* **Recover:** Ensuring all critical assets have a formal, tested backup and recovery plan, including a standardized naming convention for graphics to enable **near-immediate recovery** in the future.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of professional cybersecurity principles, from incident analysis and risk management to strategic planning and continuous improvement.
